Whaaaat? No, this is not a secret plan to assassinate an alien overlord! We are... uhm... preparating his birthday parthy! That's why we have a list with all of his friends, enemies and daily movements. Yes, a surprise birthday party! The antimatter bomb? What about it? It's just for fireworks! Yes, very fancy fireworks! Come on, don't look at me with such a face, do I look like an intergalactic terrorist to you? Wait, what are you going to do with this strange matter saber? Someone could get hurt, you know? Just put it back and give it back to my friend who is totally not hiding a laser gun behind her back. Careful... careful... No! Not to me! To her! Oh, come on, I loved my righ hand! Thanks Azathoth that I have neuro-nanotic pain killers. Now, please do me a faviour and give the saber to that nice girl I'm pointing at with my left and only reminding hand OH COME ON DID YOU NEED TO CUT THIS ONE TO? I'M STARTING TO THINK THAT YOU ARE THE TERRORIST HERE. You know what? Yes, we planned to blow this guy and his entire planetary system, but now I don't feel like it anymore! It's not like I would be able to carry with the plan anymore without hands! Here, have the dammed bomb, be careful not to activate it or billions of people could die. Wait, I don't have hands, I can't grab it. Well I'll just kick it! See? There you go OH SHI-
